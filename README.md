##OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:

##PROJECT: implementing and comparing different AI models using appropriate evaluation metrics

## OBJECTIVE:
THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS implementing and comparing different AI models usingappropriate evaluation metrics

##KEY ACTIVITIES:
-**I had created the python code first and tested it in 
-**Again I changed the test_size and random_state and tested it again.I got different outputs.

#TECHNOLOGIES USED:
-**PYTHON PROGRAMMING**:The primary programming language 
-**numpy**:NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for working with arrays and mathematical operations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and is the foundation of most scientific computing in Python.
-**pandas**:Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions for efficiently handling structured data, including tabular data such as spreadsheets and SQL tables.
-**sklearn**:Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning. It provides a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and other tasks, along with tools for model selection, data preprocessing, and feature selection.
